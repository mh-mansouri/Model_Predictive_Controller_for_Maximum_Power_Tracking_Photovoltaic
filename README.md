# Model_Predictive_Controller_for_Maximum_Power_Tracking_Photovoltaic

Designing and Developing an MPC for MPT photovoltaic fed DC-AC Converter

The main idea behind this project is to develop an MPC-based method for maximum power tracking of a series of photovoltaics that feeds a DC-AC converter. The converter is connected to the grid and controls how to provide the requested reference current despite the grid alternations. Further FFT analysis proves that the generated AC voltage and the drawn alternative current contain minimal THD.
